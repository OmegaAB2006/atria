## Troubleshooting

### Backend won't start
- Ensure Python 3.8+ is installed
- Activate virtual environment
- Install all requirements: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Check if port 5000 is available

### Frontend won't start
- Ensure Node.js 16+ is installed
- Run `npm install` in frontend directory
- Check if port 3000 is available

### GitHub analysis fails
- Check if the repository/username is public
- GitHub API has rate limits (60 requests/hour without auth)
- Add a GitHub token for higher limits

### Quiz generation fails
- Verify OpenAI API key is correct
- Check API key has sufficient credits
- Ensure internet connection is stable

## Future Enhancements
