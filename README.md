### Backend Setup

1. Navigate to the backend directory:
```bash
cd backend
```

2. Create a virtual environment:
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. The `.env` file is already created with your API key. If you need to update it:
```bash
echo "GEMINI_API_KEY=your_key_here" > .env
```

5. Start the backend server:
```bash
python app.py
```

The backend will run on http://localhost:5000

### Frontend Setup

1. Open a new terminal and navigate to the frontend directory:
```bash
cd frontend
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Start the frontend server:

- Generate quizzes tailored to your skill level
- Identify weak topics from quiz performance
- Recommend areas for improvement
- Track progress over time

## Troubleshooting

### Backend won't start
- Ensure Python 3.8+ is installed
- Activate virtual environment
- Install all requirements: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Check if port 5000 is available

### Frontend won't start
- Ensure Node.js 16+ is installed
- Run `npm install` in frontend directory
- Check if port 3000 is available

### GitHub analysis fails
- Check if the repository/username is public
- GitHub API has rate limits (60 requests/hour without auth)
- Add a GitHub token for higher limits

### Quiz generation fails
- Verify Google Gemini API key is correct
- Check API key has sufficient credits
- Ensure internet connection is stable

## Future Enhancements
