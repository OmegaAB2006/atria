* Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000
```

### Step 2: Start the Frontend
Open a **NEW** terminal and run:
```bash
cd "/home/abhignanbs/Desktop/hackathon test page/frontend"
npm start
```

You should see:
```

## 🎯 What Was Fixed

### The Problem
```
TypeError: Client.__init__() got an unexpected keyword argument 'proxies'
```

### The Solution
Updated `backend/requirements.txt` to use compatible versions:
- ✅ `openai==1.54.0` (was 1.12.0)
